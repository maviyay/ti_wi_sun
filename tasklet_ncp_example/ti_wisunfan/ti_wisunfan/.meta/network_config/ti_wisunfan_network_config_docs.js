const panID = {
    description: "Configures personal area network ID",
    longDescription: `
Used to restrict the network to a certain PAN ID. If left as 0xFFFF on the \
border router, the border router starts with a randomly selected PAN ID between 0x0000 and 0xFFFE. If this parameter is set \
to a certain value for the border router, the value should be set to either the \
same value or 0xFFFF for the router application, so that the router joins the \
intended parent.
\n\
__Default__: 0xFFFF
\n\
__Range__: 0x0000 to 0xFFFF
\n\
__Acceptable Values__: Accepts inputs in decimal, and in hexadecimal provided \
that the value is prefaced by '0x'.
`
};

const fhChannels = {
    description: "Configures channels to be scanned",
    longDescription: `
Represents the list of channels on which the device can hop. In frequency \
hopping, the actual sequence will be based on DH1CF function.
\n\
The first byte represents channels 0 to 7, and the last byte represents \
channels 128 to 135; for example, 0x01 0x10 represents the inclusion of \
channels 0 and 12.
\n\
__Default__: 0 to 128
\n\
For more information, refer to the \
[MAC and Frequency Hopping](/ti_wisunfan/html/wisun-stack/MAC.html#mac-and-frequency-hopping/\
frequency-hopping-mode.html) section of the TI Wi-SUN FAN Stack User's Guide.
`
};

const fhAsyncChannels = {
    description: "Configures channels to target async frames",
    longDescription: `
Configures the list of channels to target the async frames.
\n\
It is represented \
as a bit string with LSB representing Ch0; for example, 0x01 0x10 represents \
the inclusion of channels 0 and 12. It must cover all channels that could \
be used by a target device in its hopping sequence. Channels marked beyond \
number of channels supported by PHY Config are excluded by stack. To avoid \
interference on a channel, remove it from async mask and add it to the \
exclude channels for FH Channel Mask (\`CONFIG_FH_CHANNEL_MASK\`).
\n\
__Default__ (Border Router): 0 to 128
\n\
__Default__ (Router): 0 to 55
\n\
For more information, refer to the \
[MAC and Frequency Hopping](/ti_wisunfan/html/wisun-stack/MAC.html#mac-and-frequency-hopping/\
frequency-hopping-mode.html) section of the TI Wi-SUN FAN Stack User's Guide.

const maxDevices = {
    description: "Configures the maximum number of children for coordinator",
    longDescription: `
Configures the maximum number of children devices that can be supported by \
the coordinator. It is recommended that this value be set below 150.
\n\
__Default__: 50
\n\
__Range__: 0 to UINT16_MAX
\n\
***Additional Setup Required***:
\n\
\`MAX_DEVICE_TABLE_ENTRIES\` in the project specific .opts file must be \
updated if this parameter is modified from the default setting. For secure \
applications, \`MAX_DEVICE_TABLE_ENTRIES\` must be set equal to or greater \
than the maximum devices selected. For non-secure applications, \
\`MAX_DEVICE_TABLE_ENTRIES\` can be set to 0 to save space.

const fhNetname = {
    description: "Configures value for FH PIB attribute netname",
    longDescription: `
The network name is a unique network identifier that is configured \
by the application using frequency hopping and PAN information base (FH-PIB) \
attributes. Maintenance of the NetName is beyond the scope of TI Wi-SUN FAN Stack \
and is not used to filter frames; instead, the value is carried in a PAN \
Advertisement frame that can be parsed by a receiving application.
\n\
__Default__: Wi-SUN Network
\n\
__Acceptable Values__: 32-bit ASCII value
    `

const ccaThreshold = {
    description: "Configures network ccaThreshold",

Configures the CCA Threshold that you wish to use within the network.

\n\
__Range__: -60 to -120
`
};

const fhBroadcastInterval = {
    description: `Configures interval in ms between start of two broadcast \
slots`,
    longDescription: `
Configures the interval in milliseconds for broadcast message generation \
in frequency hopping. If set to 0, it shall disable broadcast messages and \
will not cause sleepy devices any additional power overhead.
\n\
It is recommended that this value be set above 200 ms.

Configures the interval in milliseconds for unicast message generation \
in frequency hopping. If set to 0, it shall disable unicast messages and \
will not cause sleepy devices any additional power overhead.
\n\
It is recommended that this value be set above 200 ms.

const fhBroadcastDwellTime = {
    description: `Configures duration in ms of the nodeâ€™s broadcast slot in \
frequency hopping`,
    longDescription: `
Configures the duration, in milliseconds, of a node's broadcast slot in \
frequency hopping. If set to 0, it shall disable broadcast hopping and \
broadcast message transmissions.
