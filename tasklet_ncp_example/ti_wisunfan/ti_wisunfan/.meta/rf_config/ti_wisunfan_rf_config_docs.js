The user must select an existing TI RF design to reference for radio \
configuration. This value must match the Based on RF Design parameter in the \
RF module.

configured based on the example. Please move to a custom board or see the \
other examples provided in the SDK if another reference board is desired.`

The Wi-SUN FAN standard sets a channel's center frequency using the following \
formula: ChanCenterFreq = ChanCenterFreq0 + (NumChan Ã— ChanSpacing).
